        <h1>Where'd you get the coconuts?</h1>
        <p>Why? Where'd you get the coconuts? Why? Well, she turned me into a newt.</p>
        <p>…Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Found them? In Mercia?!The coconut's tropical! She looks like one.</p>
        <h2>No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.</h2>
        <p>Be quiet! He hasn't got shit all over him. Well, I didn't vote for you. Shut up! We found them.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bloody Peasant!</li>
            <li>Well, I got better.</li>

        <h3>I am your king.</h3>
        <p>…Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Who's that then? Well, I didn't vote for you. Camelot! Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!</li>
            <li>He hasn't got shit all over him.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.bing.com">Well, we did do the nose.</a></li>

    <div class="pt1">
        <p>Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
        <p>Be quiet! Now, look here, my good man. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Burn her! Now, look here, my good man.</p>
        <p>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Look, my liege! And the hat. She's a witch! Why? Bloody Peasant!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pt2">
        <p>You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! Well, I didn't vote for you.</p>
        <p>Now, look here, my good man. I have to push the pram a lot. Look, my liege! Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! A newt?</p>
        <p>Shut up! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. She looks like one. How do you know she is a witch? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.</p>
        <p>We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Bloody Peasant! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Now, look here, my good man.</p>
        <p>Well, how'd you become king, then? You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</p>
        <p>But you are dressed as one… Burn her! Bloody Peasant! Well, she turned me into a newt.</p>
        <p>Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Did you dress her up like this? And the hat. She's a witch! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us.</p>
        <p>How do you know she is a witch? It's only a model. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Why do you think that she is a witch? A newt? Who's that then?</p>
